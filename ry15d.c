// So there's all sorts of things wrong with this.
// Mainly that you can't use malloc to create an array of strings and then get sizeof() and have that be meaningful.
// Spent far too long trying to get something to work there, oh well. Learn from my tribulations.
//
// The best part is upon doing all this, reading this little bit from the book (p85)
//
// > Pointers Are Not Arrays
// > No matter what, you should never think that pointers and arrays are the same thing. They are
// > not the same thing, even though C lets you work with them in many of the same ways. For
// > example, if you do sizeof(cur_age) in the code above, you would get the size of the pointer,
// > not the size of what it points at. If you want the size of the full array, you have to use the
// > arrayâ€™s name, age, as I did on line 12.
